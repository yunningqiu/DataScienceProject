Students who aspire to be software engineers probably already have spent four years of hard work earning their bachelor's degrees. It's a big decision whether they should go straight to the workforce or continue studying in school because of time and money. We want to investigate whether it is worth it to embark on a graduate education by looking at how much more or fewer workers who had a master's degree earned compared with workers who had a bachelor's degree in software engineering.

The problem we seek to answer:

Does a master's degree come with a higher compensation (base salary + bonus + stock grants) in software engineering?

If we find significantly larger compensation for software engineers with a master degree than those without, we could then make the conclusion that two more years of educational experience is indeed worth the time and money.
